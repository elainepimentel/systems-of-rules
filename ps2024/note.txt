============

Negative bias on atoms only means that non-bipoles (using just, say,
=> and forall) like PS-H's natural extension of natural deduction.
This is because the "barb" of synthetic rules is just an atom on the
right hand side of the sequent.  Such synthetic rules can look a lot
like natural deduction.

But if we add positive bias atoms, then the barb of synthetic rules
can contain also atoms on the left-hand side.  This looks less like
natural deduction.  So we take sequent calculus more seriously to
display such synthetic rules.

Note that positive bias seems to be used in the linearity axiom
(Goedel-Dummett logic).  Also, the story about Tseitin constants seems
to also need positive bias atoms.
