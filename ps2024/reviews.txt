TITLE: Higher-level rules for sequent calculus
AUTHORS: Dale Miller and Elaine Pimentel

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
SCORE: 2 (accept)
----- TEXT:
This abstract presents work in a line of research that enhances
sequent calculi to direct proof search with rules for theories with
the use of polarities. This is appropriate for the conference. A note
on notation: the established LJ is not correct, it should be LI (K for
Klassisch, I for Intuitionistisch). Gentzen used Sütterlin characters,
standardly printed in Fraktur, whose I upper case resembles a J, hence
the wrong transcription in Latin alphabet (see von Plato's book "Saved
from the Cellar" for the tables of Sütterlin characters).

SCORE: 2 (accept)
----- TEXT:
This abstract concerns the introduction of higher-level rules in
sequent calculus. In the context where additional inference rules are
scoped over particular proofs of premises, the authors link the
scoping of inference rules with their reading in a polarized proof
system.

TITLE: Higher-level rules for sequent calculus
AUTHORS: Dale Miller and Elaine Pimentel

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
SCORE: 3 (strong accept)
----- TEXT:
The authors examine developing approaches to higher-level rules for
both classical and intuitionistic logic proofs. They explore replacing
assumptions with inference rules, particularly for geometric formulas,
in sequent calculi. Additionally, they show how Tseitin predicate
symbols can be used to make scoped rules available globally. The
abstract is well-written and it includes examples which helps the
reader.

TITLE: Higher-level rules for sequent calculus
AUTHORS: Dale Miller and Elaine Pimentel

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
SCORE: 1 (weak accept)
----- TEXT:
This submission concerns higher-level rules for the sequent
calculus. In particular, this means investigating "whether or not an
LJ or LK proof of the sequent Γ ⊢ ∆ can be built where the formulas in
Γ (the assumptions) are replaced with inference rules. It was shown in
[6] that this replacement is possible when assumptions are geometric
formulas." The above seems to suggest that the sequent will now
contain inference rules but the subsequent discussion refers to the
addition of inference rules to the sequent calculus (rather than the
sequent itself). The topic is interesting although the abstract is not
very clear: in addition to the ambiguity above, it is not clear what
precise research problem(s) are resolved or investigated in this work.
