  "For the Workshop, we solicit submissions of short abstracts of *up
   to 2 pages* (not including references), to be presented as a short
   talk.  There are no formal published proceedings, but accepted
   abstracts will be made available for the workshop. Please submit
   your abstracts via easychair:
   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ps24".

* Topic: Using LJF / LKF to go beyond bipoles

   - A generalization of a "system of rules" 

   - Use schema variables (higher-order variables) within the LJF and
     LKF setting.  

   - Need to use the notion of "near-focused proofs" since the
     (higher-order) substitution into a focused proof is not
     focused. Note also that the schema variables can have either pos
     or neg polarities.

   - It is interesting to consider focusing on formulas that do not
     have schema variables.

     + one oplus one - yields "superposition"

     + one par one - yields mix, but only works with classical logic
       since we need the multiplicative disjunction.  The usual
       presentation of mix is as an inference rule that yields these
       implications.  Here, we have the converse: if you accept these
       formulas as axioms, you get the inference rules.  See
       https://www.pls-lab.org/en/Mix_rule.

* Cut elimination is automatic
  Discussing the cut rule is very important in this abstract. ï¿¼From
  the MMPV paper, sometime should be automatic.  However:
  "analyticity" probably needs to be argued separately and may need to
  be qualified (subformulas except for atoms....)
  
* Important examples to consider

   first-order Godel-Dummett logic.

   Hilbert's axioms for geometry, see also early work by Ketonen. 

   category theory, universal properties, etc

* Generalize previous work by using polarized formulas instead
  There is a gap between unpolarized and polarized.
  We can handle pos and neg atoms.  See discussion about Tseitin
  constants next.

* Another way to reduce the order of rules - Tseitin constants
  We could go into that a bit.  There is a bit about this in
  Manighetti's thesis.

  If we limit all formula to be of order 2, then the only thing that
  is stored (on the left) are atomic formulas.  

  Consider using Tseitin constants with the linear arity axiom.
    forall p, q [ (p -> q) \/ (q -> p) ]
  Assuming that p and q are given negative polarity, this formula is a
  member of N3.  Let's rewrite this as follows (daring to use
  higher-order quantification).

    forall p, q [ (c p q) \/ (d p q) ]    
    (c p q) equiv (p -> q), ie: (c p q) -> p -> q, (p -> q) -> (c p q)
    (d p q) equiv (q -> p), ie: (d p q) -> q -> p, (q -> p) -> (d p q) 

    Here, c and d are non-logical predicates.  They should have
    positive polarity.  Thus, instead of storing (p -> q) on the left,
    we store the atomic formula (c p q).  Instead of focusing on (p ->
    q), we can focus on ((c p q) -> p -> q).  This will produce the
    same effect.
