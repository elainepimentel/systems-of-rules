* Planning: Abstract for the Proof Society meeting in Birmingham 9-13 Sept
  https://proofsociety2024.com/
* Deadline for 2 page abstract: 17 May 2024
  Abstract deadline: May 17
  Notification: June 7
  Final version: June 14
  School: 9-11 September
  Workshop: 11-13 September

  "For the Workshop, we solicit submissions of short abstracts of *up
   to 2 pages* (not including references), to be presented as a short
   talk.  There are no formal published proceedings, but accepted
   abstracts will be made available for the workshop. Please submit
   your abstracts via easychair:
   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ps24".

* Topic: Using LJF / LKF to go beyond bipoles

   - A generalization of a "system of rules" 

   - Use schema variables (higher-order variables) within the LJF and
     LKF setting.  

   - Need to use the notion of "near-focused proofs" since the
     (higher-order) substitution into a focused proof is not
     focused. Note also that the schema variables can have either pos
     or neg polarities.

   - It is interesting to consider focusing on formulas that do not
     have schema variables.

     + one oplus one - yields "superposition"

     + one par one - yields mix, but only works with classical logic
       since we need the multiplicative disjunction.  The usual
       presentation of mix is as an inference rule that yields these
       implications.  Here, we have the converse: if you accept these
       formulas as axioms, you get the inference rules.  See
       https://www.pls-lab.org/en/Mix_rule.

* Cut elimination is automatic
  Discussing the cut rule is very important in this abstract. ï¿¼From
  the MMPV paper, sometime should be automatic.  However:
  "analyticity" probably needs to be argued separately and may need to
  be qualified (subformulas except for atoms....)
  
* Important examples to consider

   first-order Godel-Dummett logic.

   Hilbert's axioms for geometry, see also early work by Ketonen. 

   category theory, universal properties, etc
